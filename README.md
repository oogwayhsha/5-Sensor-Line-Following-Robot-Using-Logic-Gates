🚗 5 Sensors Non-Programmable Line Following Robot Using Logic Gates
- The 5-Sensor Line Following Robot is a non-programmable system that uses IR sensors, logic gates, and an H-Bridge motor driver to follow a line. Instead of microcontrollers, the robot relies on AND, OR, and NOT gates to process sensor inputs and control its motors.

✨ Features
- Non-programmable, logic-gate-based design
- 5 IR sensors for accurate line detection
- H-Bridge motor driver for reliable motor control
- Simple, low-cost, and educational project

🛠️ Components
- IR sensors, logic gate ICs (74LS04, 74LS08, 74LS32), L293N/L298N motor driver, DC motors, 7.4V battery, chassis with wheels, jumper wires, and PCB/breadboard.

📐 Overview
- Sensor signals are processed by logic gates to generate motor commands. The motor driver amplifies these signals to move the robot forward, turn, or stop, enabling line-following behavior without programming.

📈 Results

- Demonstrated line following using pure logic

- Reduced complexity by removing programming

- Future improvements: speed control, sensor calibration, compact PCB design
